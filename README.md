# Storefront-site
Introducing my new repository on Github, where I've created a website with a semantic structure using HTML and CSS. This website includes a header with the client's logo, main content with a large promotional banner and three columns of text and images, and a footer with two columns containing a smaller version of the logo and copywriting information.

To create the layout, I've used my knowledge of HTML and CSS to decide between a grid or flexbox. For styling, I've used my creativity to design an appropriate look and feel that captures the attention of the client's target audience. I've also applied my expertise in CSS selectors and effects to create intentional engagement that serves the client's best interests.

With this repository, I aim to showcase my skills in HTML and CSS while creating a website that meets the client's requirements and captures their audience's attention. This repository can also serve as a reference for those looking to create a similar website structure or seek inspiration for their web development projects.
